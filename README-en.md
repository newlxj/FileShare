## Overview
This system implements file sharing functionality, primarily designed for local sharing needs while also functioning as a file server. Administrators can create shared directories of two types:  
1. **Storage Type**: Uploaded files are stored on the server.  
2. **Link Type**: Directly links to file paths without server storage (ideal for large files over 1GB), retrieving files directly from source disks.  

**Security Note**: When using as a server, disable the `linkDirAdd` option in `server.json` configuration to prevent security risks.

## Technology Stack
‚Ä¢ **Frontend**: Vue3  
‚Ä¢ **Backend**: Golang  

## Build Instructions

### Automated Build (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `backend` directory  
2. Execute `build.bat`  
   ‚Ä¢ This script automatically builds both frontend and backend, generating an executable `fileShare.exe` with embedded frontend resources.

### Manual Build
1. **Frontend**:  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   **Critical Path Adjustment**:  
   After building, modify paths in `web/index.html` and `web/assets/index***.js` by replacing `assets/` with `fileserver/assets/` for Golang embedding.

2. **Backend**:  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   go build -o fileShare.exe
   ```

3. **Full Build**:  
   ```bash
   build.bat
   ```

## Execution
Run the generated executable:  
```bash
./fileShare.exe  # or double-click in Windows
```
‚Ä¢ Access URL: http://localhost:8080/fileserver/  
‚Ä¢ Default Admin Password: `123456`  

## Configuration Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `server.json` | Server settings (port, context path) |
| `config-group.json` | Directory configurations |
| `config-file.json` | File management settings |

## Key Features
‚úÖ Single executable deployment  
‚úÖ No separate web server required  
‚úÖ Version consistency between frontend/backend  
‚úÖ Portable installation & distribution  
‚úÖ Cross-platform support (Windows/Linux/macOS)  
‚úÖ One-click file service launch  

## Notes
‚Ä¢ Configuration files auto-generate on first run  
‚Ä¢ Default port: `8080` (configurable)  
‚Ä¢ Embedded frontend resources use configured context paths
